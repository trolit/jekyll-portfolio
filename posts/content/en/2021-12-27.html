    Let's start from statement that Prettier combined with ESLint causes sometimes problems. Even if we add dependencies
    that are supposed to help them work together by e.g. disabling conflicting rules. Because of that I've thought that
    my case concerns interaction of these tools. I've changed ESLint version, configuration and it did not help. It
    turned out that Prettier is the source of the problem.
</p>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    What was it about? When formatting component's template, Prettier forced one line formatting on tags that exceeded
    length limit (80) while spread. The goal was to force Prettier to apply proper formatting or let developer choose
    <strong>without changing config file</strong>. Let's say we have <strong>label</strong> tag and results:
</p>

<br />

{% highlight vue linenos %}

<template>
    <!-- expected formatting (good) -->
    <label for="search">
        Search
    </label>

    <!-- received formatting (wrong) -->
    <label for="search"> Search </label>
</template>

{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    Initially, two people told me that the reason behind that might be in my IDE VSC settings. I was given two
    different configurations, none of them solved the problem.
</p>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    After testing many different settings, I've looked at older project version to compare Prettier. There was used
    <strong>prettier^1</strong> and in newest one we've moved to <strong>prettier^2</strong>. ^ symbol means newest
    version <strong>but taking into account that major version needs to match</strong>. It turned out that after
    returning to <strong>prettier^1</strong> problem was solved! Tags that did not exceed single line length limit
    could be set in two ways.
</p>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    What it comes from? I have my assumptions that are not confirmed but seems reasonable :D. Let's return
    to the <strong>label</strong> example and slightly modify it to picture the reason.
</p>

<br />

{% highlight vue linenos %}

<template>
    <b-container fluid>
        <b-row>
            <b-col>
                <!-- label1 -->
                <label for="search">
                    Search
                </label>

                <!-- label2 -->
                <label for="search"> Search </label>
            </b-col>
        </b-row>
    </b-container>
</template>

{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    <em>Label1</em> has 90 characters (including indentations) while <em>label2</em> 52. It might seem that Prettier
    should leave <em>label1</em> formatting because when spreading that tag among 3 lines we've exceeded row length
    limit (80) but it does not work like that for <strong>prettier^2</strong>.
</p>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    <em>Label1</em> will still be formatted to <em>label2</em>. Why? I have the impression that in
    <strong>prettier^2</strong> there was change in approach to indentation counting inside tags. If
    we take a look again at <em>label1</em>, exactly on 7th line
</p>

<br />

{% highlight vue linenos %}

<template>
    <b-container fluid>
        <b-row>
            <b-col>
                <!-- label1 -->
                <label for="search">
                    Search
                </label>
            </b-col>
        </b-row>
    </b-container>
</template>

{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    20 spaces (4 tabs) between document start and Search word are not taken into account. Prettier treats that
    indentation like it would be single whitespace character and because of that <em>label1</em> has 70 characters
    instead of 90 which means that it didn't exceed limit and can be formatted into single line!
</p>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    Once we return to <strong>prettier^1</strong>, indentations inside &lt;label&gt; tag will be correctly taken into
    account (correctly in the context of set goal) and we will be able to write down &lt;label&gt; in two ways:
    <em>label1</em> or <em>label2</em> ü§†üëç

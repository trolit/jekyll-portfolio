    <strong>Shields.io</strong> is an tool used to quickly deliver short information in form of badges. They can be used as anchors or to present static/dynamic information(e.g. number of online users at Discord channel, number of opened pull requests). On offical project website you can find a lot of predefined labels that needs to be filled with some basic data to generate link to that badge.

    Badges(style, content) can be modified at any time by changing particular places in generated address or by doing it during label configuration. <a href="https://shields.io/" target="_blank">Shields.io</a> also allows to create own badges(dynamic too) or getting them by sending request at <a href="https://shields.io/endpoint" target="_blank">endpoint</a>. It's great tool for open source projects. In case of private ones, you can think of personal shields instance deployed on e.g. Docker, Heroku, Vercel <a href="https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#hosting-your-own-shields-server" target="_blank">(see how)</a>.

    You are surely aware of what developer console is. We can add commands in it which for e.g. speed up certain conditions
    to be able to test different scenarios without wasting time to fullfil previous ones and in complex projects there are a
    lot of these. Scene preconditions modification isn't that convenient like console because it requires you to do changes
    in different places, discard them and at another point a re-addition.

    In my case project that was eligible for adding console was <a href="https://github.com/trolit/projectZero" 
    target="_blank">Project Zero</a>. Due to the fact that the game was performed by two people, game had to be
    large enough.

    I've started looking after example on how to make dev console. I've managed to find an idea from <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmG1UbEI0iFE1tAw2SyvvXg" target="_blank">Joey The Lantern</a>.
    I've modified his console with few things. I didn't add Unity logs to it but it can be found on the 
    author's channel. I've decided to share my version from Project Zero as separate repository. From the
    perspective of the end of that project I can say that sacrificing several hours to prepare commands and
    console itself definitely paid back and shorten the time spent on patching bugs :)

    If you're interested, console template repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/trolit/unity-dev-console" 
    target="_blank">here</a> (check README for more details), while example of applying it to Project Zero game, 
    <a href="https://github.com/trolit/projectZero/tree/master/projectZero/Assets/Scripts/Dev" target="_blank">here</a> 
    (there are more commands üòÅ).

<div class="ui large header stylize-header">Adding command</div>

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    Create class named <code>CommandX</code> where <code>X</code> is short title of your command (to follow convention).
    Command class template could look like this:
</p>

{% highlight cs linenos %}
public class CommandX : ConsoleCommand
{
    public sealed override string Name { get; protected set; }
    public sealed override string Command { get; protected set; }
    public sealed override string Description { get; protected set; }
    public sealed override string Help { get; protected set; }
    public sealed override string Example { get; protected set; }

    public CommandX()
    {
        Name = ""; // title of the command
        Command = ""; // text that will be recognized as command
        Description = ""; // give your command nice desc!
        Help = ""; // here you can put syntax for example
        Example = "";

        AddCommandToConsole();
    }

    public override void RunCommand(string[] data)
    {
        // put body of your command here
        // remember to properly secure
        // all cases, watch which pos
        // of array you are referring to
    }

    // creates command object
    public static CommandX CreateCommand()
    {
        return new CommandX();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    When defining <code>RunCommand</code>, don't forget to check common console messages prepared in <code>DevConsole</code>
    class. If you won't find appropriate one, make new one. If command will be ready, just call static method 
    <code>CreateCommand()</code> of the new command in <code>DevConsole</code> script in <code>CreateCommands()</code> and
    done, you can start testing it üòâ

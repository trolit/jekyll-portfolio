    Pixlr is known to me since 2012 and the purpose of the post is informed, voluntary recommendation üôÇ. It serves me
    to remove the background, edit a photo or create new one from collected clippings. As for the advantages, first of
    all it does not require any software installation and account creation. It allows to load images directly from URL.
    Project can be saved in special format to restore it's structure. Pixlr contains nice effects, stickers, brush for
    overwriting specified color, cutting out (including lasso). I won't go into details of it's features since there is
    too much to describe :D. We have versions X (Express) and E (Editor) available depending on whether we need to make
    quick modification (X) or work on advanced project (E). Personally I'm used to Pixlr Editor because Express GUI is
    too minimalistic to me. Pixlr's can be used for free, no watermarks. Of course there are ads and limits e.g. limited
    number of icons, stickers but still it isn't restricted like some other apps where you are literally forced to buy
    paid version or you won't finish your work. It can be extended with optional <a href="https://pixlr.com/pricing"
        target="_blank">premium</a> package which isn't invasive and adds more features (details in pricing section).

    Pixlr authors constantly develop their software. Recently it has been extended with animations panel. <strong>If you
        are looking after convenient graphics editor</strong> which: isn't complicated, is available online, does not
    force to create account, free version isn't stripped down in a way that it's unusable (support creators and don't
    block ads üíô), has a lot of interesting features then <strong>Pixlr is good candidate üòÅ</strong>

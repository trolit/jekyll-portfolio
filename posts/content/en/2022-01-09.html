    Pixlr is known to me since 2012 and the purpose of the post is informed, voluntary recommendation üôÇ. It serves me
    to remove the background, edit a photo or create new one from collected clippings. As for the advantages, first of
    all it does not require any software installation. It allows to load images directly from URL. Project can be
    saved in special format to store it's structure and reopen it. Pixlr contains nice effects, stickers, brush for
    overwriting specified color, cutting out (including lasso). We have versions X (Express) and E (Editor) depending
    on whether we need to make quick modification (X) or work on advanced project (E). Free version can be optionally
    extended with <a href="https://pixlr.com/pricing" target="_blank">premium</a> package which isn't invasive. Some
    elements marked as premium have been prepared in such way that in the free version you have to wait a while to be
    able to use them in project. More opinions about Pixlr can be found <a
        href="https://reviews.financesonline.com/p/pixlr/" target="_blank">here</a>, license terms <a
        href="https://pixlr.com/license-and-services-agreement/" target="_blank">here</a> and below comparision
    between X and E GUI.

    Pixlr authors constantly develop their software. Recently it has been extended with animations panel. <strong>If you
        are looking after convenient graphics editor</strong> which: isn't complicated, is available online, does not
    force to create account, free version isn't stripped down in a way that it's unusable (support creators and don't
    block ads üíô), has a lot of interesting features then <strong>Pixlr is good candidate üòÅ</strong>

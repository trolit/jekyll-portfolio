Imagine situation where you have some currency in game which can be spent on some elements. Instead of spending 10
minutes in IDE collecting required amount, you can click button that triggers <em>AddMoney()</em> and done. You can
of course use console and type command but in that case I think that button is more effective.

    Different situation: you want to check whether all books give valid notification after they are read. You can
    get each book by:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>wandering around the world and spending currency on it,</li>
    <li>prepare special command to dev console that will unlock all at once,</li>
</ul>

    or... simply adding an button. Setting up buttons under scripts are especially useful in the final stages of project
    checking or verifying if scripts are working as expected. Under button you can attach not only operation that
    manipulates current state of the game (adding funds, skill points, objects), but also the one that debugs situation. 
    As a result it reduces necessity to type in <em>Debug.Log</em> in particular place and after verification commenting
    or removing it. It may happen again that we will need to check same script and be forced to add or uncomment
    instructions outputting information to console so alternative with buttons sounds very useful.

    Unity does not include that feature by default but it allows to modify IDE. I've used ready solution shared at GitHub,
    <em>EasyButtons</em>. Buttons are rendered within special attribute placed above functions, <strong>[Button]</strong>.
    If we setup functions and decorate them with mentioned attribute, we will get following effect in Unity's Inspector:

    In example above, I use first button to verify current minigame state and second one to force win, regardless of the 
    state of the game. The implementations are as follows:
</p>

<br />

{% highlight cs linenos %}
using EasyButtons;

[Button]
public void CheckCurrentGameState()
{
    Debug.Log($"<b>{PuzzleStatus}</b> out of <b>{_puzzleAmount}</b> blocks are placed correctly.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

<br />

{% highlight cs linenos %}
using EasyButtons;

[Button]
public void TriggerWinManually()
{
    TriggerWin();
}
{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    Those examples are from <a href="https://github.com/trolit/projectZero/blob/master/projectZero/Assets/Scripts/Minigame_Puzzle/PuzzleManager.cs" 
    target="_blank">that</a> script of Project Zero game. You may notice that these functions do not have any parameters. In <em>EasyButtons</em>
    you can't decorate functions with <strong>[Button]</strong> that have parameters or they won't appear in the Inspector. At the first look
    it might look as an obstacle. But if we want to pass some data, we can work around it by calling another function inside decorated method 
    that can already have parameters. Simple example:
</p>

<br />

{% highlight cs linenos %}
using EasyButtons;

[Header("Teleport To Destination Button Data")]
[SerializeField]
private float _X;

[SerializeField]
private float _Y;

[SerializeField]
private float _Z;

[Button]
public void TeleportToDestination()
{
    SetCharacterPosition(_X, _Y, _Z);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<br />

<p class="justify-text stylize-text">
    So you can deal with it easily and don't have to modify <em>EasyButtons</em> logic. Using <em>EasyButtons</em> is that easy.
    You just need to add it to your project, import dependencies and decorate parameterless function with <strong>[Button]</strong>
    attribute. That's all!
